# Surface-Vessel-Temp-Logger
### This is a set of two programs that can be used to continuously record temperature data that is GPS referenced via a USB GPS unit. My version of it was mounted on an unmanned surface vessel (a 1/32 scale model ship) with the GPS on the "bridge" roof and the temperature sensor deployed in the water. It includes a Python file (ideal for a Raspberry Pi main vessel computer) and a C++ file (for an Arduino used as an A/D converter for an analog thermistor setup).
